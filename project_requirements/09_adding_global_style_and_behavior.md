# Adding Global Style and Behavior

## Requirements

1. When a message is displayed to a user, that message should appear against a yellow background.
2. Messages should disappear if the page they appear on is reloaded
3. Text files should continue to be displayed by the browser as plain text
4. The entire site (including markdown files, but not text files) should be displayed in a sans-serif typefact.

## My Implementation Steps

1. Add yellow background coloring to the display message (note: convert all messages to generic :message in sessions instead of :error and :success)
2. Disappear on reload already accomplished
3. Text files shouldn't be hampered by any changes here.
4. Set typeface to sans-serif with some styling.
